# Machine-Learning & Data-Science-Masterclass_-by-Jose-Portilla

**Jose Portillaâ€™s Machine Learning and Data Science Masterclass** offers a comprehensive guide to mastering key concepts in **Python, data science, and machine learning**. This course covered essential topics, starting from the **fundamentals of Python programming, leading into data manipulation using pandas, and data visualization with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly**.

For **machine learning**, the course delves into practical techniques using **SciKit-Learn, including algorithms like Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), K-Means Clustering, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines (SVM)**. The course also introduces Natural Language Processing (NLP), Neural Networks, and Deep Learning.
