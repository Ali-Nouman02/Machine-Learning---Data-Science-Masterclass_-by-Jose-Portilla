# Fandango Movie Ratings Analysis

## Overview

This project investigates the validity of the Fandango movie rating system, focusing on an article published in 2015 that accused Fandango of manipulating its ratings to retain viewers. The analysis is divided into three main parts:

## Part One: Data Preparation and Exploration

- **Data Collection:** Gathered relevant datasets related to Fandango ratings and movie performance.
- **DataFrame Preparation:** Cleaned and transformed the data to create usable DataFrames for analysis.
- **Visual Exploration:** Utilized scatter plots to explore the relationship between movie ratings and the number of votes.

## Part Two: In-Depth Data Analysis

- **Data Cleaning:** Further refined the data for accuracy and relevance.
- **Visualization Techniques:** 
  - Employed scatter plots to analyze the correlation between ratings and votes.
  - Created Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) plots to compare true ratings against Fandango ratings, providing insights into the distribution of scores.

## Part Three: Comparative Analysis

- **Rating Comparison:** Compared Fandango ratings with ratings from other well-known platforms, including Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, and IMDb.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Conducted various statistical analyses, including:
  - Histograms and count plots to visualize rating distributions.
  - Correlation matrices to identify relationships between different rating systems.
  - Cluster maps to analyze similarities and differences in ratings across platforms.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Fandango's rating practices in comparison to other major movie rating sites, highlighting potential discrepancies and raising questions about the integrity of their rating system.
